# 12-Weeks-of-Code-Learning

The 12 weeks of code learning is a repo/journal of my progress and
thoughts over the next 12 weeks as I learn various web development
languages, technologies and software.
It also acts as a way for me to practice building consistency in not
only my learning journey, but as well as my interaction with the
languages on a daily basis regardless of how little progress I make.
