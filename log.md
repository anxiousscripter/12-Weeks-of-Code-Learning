# 100 Days of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 13, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Completed an Hour and Thirty Minutes of HTML

**Thoughts:** Watching an hour and 30 minutes worth of lessons was definitely
harder than I thought it would be. The lessons were pretty much revision
excluding links where I learnt about the download attribute and how to link to
an email or telephone number.

**Link to Work:** [Project-Name](Link Unavailable)
