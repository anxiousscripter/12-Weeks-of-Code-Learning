# 12 Weeks of Code - Log

# WEEK 1

### Day 1: October 13, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Completed an Hour and Thirty Minutes of HTML

**Thoughts:** Watching an hour and 30 minutes worth of lessons was definitely
harder than I thought it would be. The lessons were pretty much revision
excluding links where I learnt about the download attribute and how to link to
an email or telephone number.

### Day 2: October 14, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Completed an Hour and Thirty Minutes of HTML

**Thoughts:** I was happy to have learnt about images, semantics, tables, and a
bit about forms and input. I definitely need to revise these topics but my
favorite was learning about semantics. It makes it easier for me to work when I
know that I'm atleast using the appropriate tags when building projects.

### Day 3: October 15, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Completed Dave Gray's HTML for Beginners Course

**Thoughts:** Working on the ending project was fun. I definitely forgot how
to use some semantic elements, but overall I think I did pretty well for my
first attempt without any reference to previous lessons or looking at the
solution files.

### Day 4: October 18, 2025 [Missed 2 Days]

**Today's Progress:** Created 3 Site Samples and Covered a Few Minutes of a Figma Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Creating the site samples was pretty easy using AI but the prompt
definitely had to be thorough for it to give me the results I wanted.
As for learning to use Figma, its definitely coming off tougher than I expected
but I guess the challenges are where I'll learn the most.

### Day 5: October 19, 2025

**Today's Progress:** Built a Figma Webpage in HTML

**Thoughts:** Building out the page was an enjoyable experience. I tried my
best to use whatever I could remember from the HTML course I took, as well as
make use of the most appropriate semnatic elements when building out the page.
I'm excited to see how this turns out once I start styling it with CSS.
